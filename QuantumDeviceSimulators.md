There are several open-source simulators for quantum computers right now. Some good reviews

are available. Most of them are mainly focused on quantum algorithm instead of quantum error correction (QEC). Here I give a review on the situation of noise simulation for QEC on those simulators.

### Cirq @Google
[noise channel is in development](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/issues/730).
