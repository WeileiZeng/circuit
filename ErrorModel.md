Any rotation on the state of a qubit can result in an error. ref pointed out that, since quantum state collapse while measurement, the final state would be I,X,Y,Z acting on the state. As Y is a superposition of X and Z, we can always only worry about X,Z errors.

talk about how to generate error and how error propagate.
point out the special case.

why don;t I write in the format of latex?
